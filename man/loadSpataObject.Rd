\description{
Family of functions to load corresponding objects of different analysis
platforms. See details and value for more information.
}
\details{
\code{loadSpataObject()} is a wrapper around \code{base::readRDS()} with which
you could load your spata-object as well. The other two functions take the spata-object
and use \code{getDirectoryInstructions()} to extract the directories of the corresponding object to be loaded under which
they were saved the last time \code{saveCorresponding*()} was used.
