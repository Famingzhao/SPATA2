  n_bins_circle,
  n_angle_bins = 12,
  summarize_with = "mean",

  model_subset = NULL,
  model_remove = NULL,
  layout = 1,
  switch = NULL,
  fill = "steelblue",
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{Any object for which a method has been defined.}

\item{variables}{Character vector. The numeric variables of interest. Must be inside:

\itemize{
  \item{ \strong{Gene sets} Must be in \code{getGeneSets()}}
  \item{ \strong{Genes} Must be in \code{getGenes()}}
  \item{ \strong{Features} Must be in \code{getFeatureNames(..., of_class = "numeric")}}
  }}

\item{buffer}{The distance by which to consecutively expand the
area that covers the image annotation screening. Given to argument
\code{dist} of function \code{sf::st_buffer()}.}

\item{n_bins_circle}{Numeric value (or vector of length two, see details
for more). Specifies how many times the area is buffere with the value
denoted in \code{buffer}. The combination of both results in area that is
screened.}

\item{summarize_with}{Character value. Either \emph{'mean'} or \emph{'median'}.
Specifies the function with which the bins are summarized.}

\item{model_subset}{Character value. Used as a regex to subset the models
that are known to \code{SPATA2}. Use \code{validModelNames()} to obtain all model names
and \code{showModels()} to visualize them.}

\item{model_remove}{Character value. Used as a regex to remove models
are not supposed to be included in the screening process.}

\item{model_add}{Named list. Every slot in the list must be either a formula
containing a function that takes a numeric vector as input and returns a numeric
vector with the same length as its input vector. Or a numeric vector with the
same length as the input vector. Test models with \code{showModels()}.}

\item{switch}{By default, the labels are displayed on the top and
right of the plot. If \code{"x"}, the top labels will be
displayed to the bottom. If \code{"y"}, the right-hand side
labels will be displayed to the left. Can also be set to
\code{"both"}.}

\item{fill}{Character value. The color with which the columns are filled.}
}
\description{
Visualize the evaluation of the fit of a numeric variable
against models around the area on an image annotation.
